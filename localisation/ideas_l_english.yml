 GER_A_State_Disarmed_desc: "Following the end of the Second World War and collapse of the Third Reich,, Germany was completely restructured from the ground up. The \"German Democratic People's Republic\" that was founded a few years later was not as a continuation of the previous Reich, it was a whole new nation. The previous government, state, and all organisations associated with it were considered criminal organisations. However, they still had restrictions placed on them which are still active today. Similar to the Weimar Republic, they have a demilitarised zone in the Rhineland and an army limited to one-hundred thousand men."
